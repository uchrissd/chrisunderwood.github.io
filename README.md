This is a repo of a responsive version of my portfolio site. This site uses a combination of Bootstrap and my own custom CSS to make the three pages of this site responsive to different screen sizes. Each page uses the Bootstrap grid system. 


I failed to achieve the level of responsiveness I was going for. I assume I should have used more media queries or found a better way to lay out the grid on the portfolio page. I clearly need more practice in order to master the Bootstrap grid system.
